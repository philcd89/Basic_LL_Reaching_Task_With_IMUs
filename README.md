# Basic Lower Limb Reaching Task With IMUs

This code is a first attempt at developing a basic lower limb reaching task in which participants make lower limb movements (e.g., knee or hip flexion/extension) while Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) control a cursor on a screen and move it between two points.  This code uses [MotionNode](https://www.motionnode.com/) sensors and borrows heavily from their SDK.
