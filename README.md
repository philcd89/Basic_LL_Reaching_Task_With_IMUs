# Basic_LL_Reaching_Task_With_IMUs

The purpose of this project is to create a basic reaching task using IMUs to control a cursor on a screen with lower limb movements (i.e., knee or hip flexion/extension).  This project uses [MotionNode](https://www.motionnode.com/) sensors and pulls heavily from their SDK.
